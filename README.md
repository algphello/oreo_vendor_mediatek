# How to apply the patches ?
Patches located in the patches folder can be applied from the root of your android sources :  
`. vendor/mediatek/install.sh` & `. vendor/mediatek/uninstall.sh` 

# How to configure libshim ?
Libshim is divided into bits which will generate `LINKER_FORCED_SHIM_LIBS` for you, you don't need to `export LD_SHIM_LIBS`.  
The only configuration libshim needs is the following flags :  
`#LIBSHIM_XLOG_SYMBOLS :=true`  
`#LIBSHIM_SND_SYMBOLS := true`  
`#LIBSHIM_UI_SYMBOLS := true`  
`#LIBSHIM_GUI_SYMBOLS := true`  
`#LIBSHIM_OMX_SYMBOLS := true`  
`#LIBSHIM_AGPS_SYMBOLS := true`  
(copy/paste in `BoardConfig.mk` & uncomment the flags you need)

# Optional :
- building TWRP in LOS-15.x tree (temp fix) : `patches/optional/0001-TEMP-TWRP-fix-recovery-build-with-f2fs-on-LOS-15.x-t.patch`
